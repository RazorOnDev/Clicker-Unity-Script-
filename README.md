# Clicker Unity Script
Just a simple MonoBehavior for clicker-themed games written in c # to be used in Unity3D.

Rename the vars to the name you want and attach the "ClickVarSum" method/void to the GameObject that you want. This is a simple public script and you can ask me some doubt or do a pull request.
